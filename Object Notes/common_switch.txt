Switches that can fire off various events.

First parameter (a signed 32 bit integer) controls the behaviour of the switch itself. Used values within the actual game's set data are:
1 = Remains on permantly after being pressed.
2 = Deactivates when unpressed.
3 = Turn off after time specified in the fourth parameter.
4 = Toggles the switch on and off everytime it is pressed.
5 = Seems same as 1?
Second parameter (a string) is the name of an event to fire when the switch is turned on; specified in the stage's LUA file. Game appears to crash if this is left blank.
Third parameter (a string) is the name of an event to fire when the switch is turned off; specified in the stage's LUA file. (I think?)
Fourth parameter (a single) controls how long a switch with a behaviour mode of 3 will remain on for.
Fith parameter (an unsigned 32 bit integer) is the object to be activated by this switch.
