Seems to only be used in a test set and in the Iblis Phase 1 fight for Silver.

First three parameters are volume size.
Fourth parameter (a single) always appears to be set to 1?
Fifth parameter (a string) would appear to be the name of a csb file in sound.arc.
Sixth parameter (a string) might be the name of the sound in the supplied csb to play?
