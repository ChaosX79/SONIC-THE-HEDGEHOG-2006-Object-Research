# General Object Notes
* Square Volumes appear to be set up like a box in 3DS Max, meaning the parameters for it go Length, Width, Height. As opposed to the initially assumed Width, Height, Length.
* Objects that target another can usually have their value set to 4294967295 to target nothing. For example, this will make a Spring simply launch the player in the direction it is pointing and will mark a Chain Jump object as being the last one in the sequence.
