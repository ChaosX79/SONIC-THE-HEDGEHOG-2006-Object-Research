Exports splines made in 3DS Max to 06's Path Format. Seems to have some weird problems with scale, so I would recommend exporting them to an OBJ file first & reimporting that before exporting. autodesk plz fix

The splines don't seem to need any actual naming, as they seem to be based on the file itself.
