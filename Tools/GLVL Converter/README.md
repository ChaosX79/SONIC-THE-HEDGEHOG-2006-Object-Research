An incredibly bodged together tool to convert the Generations SET Data using these templates from this repository to 06, a lot of objects will be setup incorrectly, as most values that needs maths done to them will not be handled correctly without manual code modification.

Objects that have a default target value will also crash the converter, due to GLVL and HedgeLib being rather dumb.

I was holding off on uploading this for a while, but I really feel like I should just get it out there.
